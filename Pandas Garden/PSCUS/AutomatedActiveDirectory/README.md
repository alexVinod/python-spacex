What is RPyC :
---------------

1. RPyC, or Remote Python Call, is a Python library for remote procedure calls, as well as distributed computing.
2. Unlike regular RPC mechanisms, such as ONC RPC, CORBA or Java RMI, RPyC is transparent, symmetric, and requires
    no special decoration or definition languages.
3. Moreover, it provides programmatic access to any pythonic element, be it functions, classes, instances or modules.
